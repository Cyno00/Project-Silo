	<h1 class = "title"> Electronic Recycling: Why It Matters </h1>
	
	<p> Smartphones and computers have become indispensible parts of our lives. We use them to learn, to conduct business, or just to watch movies. When you buy a new device, what will you do with your old device? Keep it as a backup? Sell it to a recycling company? Or throw it away? We at [PROJECT NAME] hope that you do anything except throw it away in the trash. </p>
	
	<p> Every year, 50 million tons of electornic waste is generated, most of which contain toxic chemicals such as lead, which harms the environment and people who work at the landfill. In order to prevent these materials from being released to the environment, we need to recycle them, which keeps these materials in our devices. </p>

		<h2>About the Project</h2>
		<hr>
		<p> The process of making any electronics is extremely complex and requires a lot of material. Where does tech companies source their materials? We as consumers are disconnected from the "black box", and make our purchases based on price alone. This helps us distance ourselves from the ugly face of capitalism and industrial society: the exploitation of the natural world and the underpreviledged. Truthfully, the carbon footprint of modern electronics is immense, and so are the ecological and ethical concerns of obtaining tons of minerals like Tin and Cobalt. Through this project, we aim to raise awareness about the many problems that are yet to be solved in the production of consumer electronics, and to provide resources on how to recycle your device as a concrete way for you to save materials/labor and to do your part to keep the Earth livable for the coming years.
